# The Spiral Order Traversal for a Matrix
The given code defines a function named spiralOrder that takes a 2D integer array (int[][]) as input and returns a 1D integer array (int[]) which contains the elements of the input array arranged in a spiral order.

The main function calls the spiralOrder function with a sample 2D integer array, and then prints the returned 1D integer array using the io:println function.

## `spiralOrder(int[][] matrix) returns int[]` 
The spiralOrder function starts by initializing an empty 1D integer array result to hold the spiral ordered elements of the input matrix. It also initializes four variables rowStart, rowEnd, colStart, and colEnd, which represent the indices of the current boundaries of the matrix.

The function then enters a while loop which runs as long as the current indices of the matrix boundaries satisfy the condition rowStart <= rowEnd && colStart <= colEnd. This condition ensures that the function does not try to access elements outside the boundaries of the matrix.

The first step in each iteration of the while loop is to traverse the top row of the matrix, starting from colStart and going up to colEnd. The elements in this row are appended to the result array using the result.push method. After this, the rowStart index is incremented by 1.

The second step in each iteration of the while loop is to traverse the right column of the matrix, starting from rowStart and going down to rowEnd. The elements in this column are appended to the result array using the result.push method. After this, the colEnd index is decremented by 1.

The third step in each iteration of the while loop is to traverse the bottom row of the matrix, but only if the current rowStart index is still less than or equal to the rowEnd index. This condition ensures that the function does not try to access elements outside the boundaries of the matrix. The elements in this row are appended to the result array using the result.push method. After this, the rowEnd index is decremented by 1.

The fourth and final step in each iteration of the while loop is to traverse the left column of the matrix, but only if the current colStart index is still less than or equal to the colEnd index. This condition ensures that the function does not try to access elements outside the boundaries of the matrix. The elements in this column are appended to the result array using the result.push method. After this, the colStart index is incremented by 1.

Once the while loop has completed, the function returns the result array, which contains the elements of the input matrix arranged in a spiral order.
